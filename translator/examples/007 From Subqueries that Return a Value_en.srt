1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,920
Let's very briefly take a look at another example of using a subquery inside of a from clause.

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,030
After that, we'll then understand why we would do this at all.

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,850
Why do we care about using subqueries inside of a from.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,460
So in this particular example we're going to see that we do not have to return a set of rows or columns

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,190
from a subquery inside of a from clause.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,340
We can return just one single value as long as the outer select statements, the wares and so on are

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,630
compatible with it.

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,790
So in this case, we're going to write out a subquery that's going to give us back one single value.

9
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,840
Just one value.

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:41,070
Selecting the maximum price means let's take a look at the price column by itself, nothing else.

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,800
And we want to get just the max value inside of here.

12
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:49,190
So in this case, it would be the 989 that is the result of our subquery.

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,440
It is one row and one column which referred to as a value.

14
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,230
That's one single value.

15
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,950
We can make use of this as a subquery inside of a from clause.

16
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:06,100
So long as the outer select or any additional wares group buys and so on are working or assuming that

17
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,430
we are making use or providing just one single value.

18
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:15,190
So if we now try to do a select and say something like give me all the product names, that's going

19
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,510
to break because we don't have any names here.

20
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:23,020
If we try to ask for, say, the weights again, we're going to break because we don't have a weight

21
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:23,710
column.

22
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,800
The only thing we can ask for here is just everything.

23
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,370
Give us everything, which in this case is one single value.

24
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:36,050
Let's try once again writing out just the sub query and then integrating that into a larger query on

25
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:36,890
the outside.

26
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,030
So once again, do a select max price from products.

27
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:43,690
Yep.

28
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,250
We get just one value right here.

29
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,280
Now we will integrate that into a larger outer query.

30
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,440
We'll say select Star from and we'll put in our sub query.

31
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:59,130
Select Max Price from products.

32
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,580
And then let's not forget to apply our alias right here.

33
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,540
So as.

34
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,210
All right.

35
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,570
So I'm going to run that and you'll see that we get the exact same result.

36
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,010
So again, this is a scenario where we don't really need the outer query.

37
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,120
I just mean to give this to you as an example of, hey, we can provide a sub query right here that

38
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,730
gives us one single value as long as the outer selects and so on are going to agree with the structure

39
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,450
of data.

40
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,140
All right.

41
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,680
So now that we have seen that a sub query inside of a from clause can give us either a set of rows and

42
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,960
columns or just one single value.

43
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,660
Let's now start to understand why we would do this.

44
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,470
Why would we ever make use of a sub query inside of a from clause?

45
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,090
That's the real question here.

46
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,060
So quick pause and we'll take a look at that in just a moment.
